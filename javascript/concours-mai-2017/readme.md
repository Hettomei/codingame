# Imported from codin game
Code4Life is a special contest. Don't be surprised or deterred if it takes you longer than usual to have your first AI working; it's totally normal! You can view this first part as solving a medium puzzle. Then, it's a classic multiplayer league based game.

Produce medicines and maximize your score by transporting items across a medical complex.

# Rules

A game is played with 2 players. Each player controls one robot.

The complex is composed of 3 modules named DIAGNOSIS, MOLECULES and LABORATORY.
The robots can transfer two types of items from and to the modules: sample data files and molecules.

In a nutshell, you have to optimize your robot movements to:
Collect sample data files from the cloud at the DIAGNOSIS module.

Gather required molecules for the medicines at the MOLECULES module.
Produce the medicines at the LABORATORY module and collect your health points.

 	Details

The robots

Each player has one robot. Both robots have the same starting position.

A robot can carry up to 3 sample data files and 10 molecules.

A player can move their robot from one module to another by means of the GOTO module command.
Once the robot is at a module's interface, it can connect to it with the CONNECT command. This will have a different effect for each module.

Sample data
A sample data file is an item representing all known data on a tissue sample collected from an untreated patient. Researching this sample may ultimately lead to the production of medicine to prolong the lives of all patients with the same ailment.
A sample data is associated with the list of molecules needed to produce the medicine for that sample.
A sample data will grant you a variable number of health points when you research it.

Molecules
A molecule can be one of five types: A, B, C, D or E.

Modules


The diagnosis machine

Connecting to this module with CONNECT id will transfer the sample data file identified by id from the cloud of the diagnosis machine to your robot.

The molecule distribution module
Connecting to this module with CONNECT type, where type is one of the molecule types, will transfer an available molecule to your robot of the desired type.

The laboratory module
To use this module, the player's robot must be carrying a sample data file as well as the required amount of molecules for producing that sample's medicine.

Connecting to this module with CONNECT id where id is the identifier of a diagnosed sample data the player can research, will have several effects:

The sample data id as well as the associated molecules are removed from play.

The players scores as many points as the sample's health points.

The player acquires molecule expertise: the robot will need 1 less molecule of the type specified by the sample for producing all subsequent medicines.

Victory Conditions
Your robot has scored the most health points after 200 turns or once a player has at least 170 points.

Lose Conditions
You fail to provide valid output.

# Game Input

Initialization input
Line 1: always 0. Ignore for this league and do not remove for the next leagues.

Input for one game turn
For each player, 1 line: 1 string followed by 12 integers (you are always the first player):
target: module where the player is.

eta: ignore for this league.

score: the player's number of health points

storageA, storageB, storageC, storageD, storageE: number of molecules held by the player for each molecule type.

expertiseA, expertiseB, expertiseC, expertiseD, expertiseE: ignore this for this league.

Next line:availableA, availableB, availableC, availableD, availableE: number of available molecules. Ignore for this league, there are always enough molecules available.

Next line:sampleCount: the number of samples currently in the game.

Next sampleCount lines:

sampleId: unique id for the sample.
carriedBy: 0 if the sample is carried by you, 1 by the other robot, -1 if the sample is in the cloud.
rank: ignore for this league.
gain: ignore for this league.
health: number of health points you gain from this sample.

costA, costB, costC, costD, costE: number of molecules of each type needed to research the sample
Output for one game turn
Each turn issue one of the following command:

GOTO module: move towards the target module.
CONNECT id/type: connect to the target module with the specified sample id or molecule type.
